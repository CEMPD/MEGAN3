How this code came about

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MEGAN preprocessing tool for CMAQ in this directory is based on
one written for WRF-Chem by Gabriele Pfister, Stacy Walters, and
Xiaoyan Jiang of NCAR.  This file describes the modifications made to
the WRF-Chem-relevant version in creating the CMAQ-relevant version
here.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


  * Started from the preprocessor for WRF-Chem
    http://www.acd.ucar.edu/webt/MEGAN/MEGAN_prep.tar.gz
    that was downloaded on 2014-05-02.

    (A copy of the above-mentioned  MEGAN_prep.tar.gz is retained as
    prepmegan4wrfchem.tar.gz in the current directory.)

  * Split bio_emiss.f90_newef into three separate programs: 

       prepmegan4cmaq_lai.f90
       prepmegan4cmaq_pft.f90
       prepmegan4cmaq_ef.f90

    This splitting into three programs results in some code
    redundancy, but flexibility is gained in that the three *.csv
    output files necessary as input to run MEGAN can be created
    indepedently of each other.

  * Makefile and make_util have been updated so that the corresponding
    compilation commands are

       make_util prepmegan4cmaq_lai.x
       make_util prepmegan4cmaq_pft.x
       make_util prepmegan4cmaq_ef.x

  * Removed subroutine write_bioemiss from the three *.f90 files
    mentioned above.  This subroutine is needed for WRF-Chem but is
    not needed for CMAQ.

  * Modified the three *.f90 files mentioned above so output domain is
    that of MCIP/CMAQ, which is usually smaller than the WRF/WRF-Chem
    domain.  This is done by adding a new group of namelist variables
    "windowdefs", of which the variable names and values should be the
    same as those used when running MCIP. CELL_ID, ICELL, and JCELL
    values written to the *.csv output files are modified accordingly.

  * Modified the three *.f90 files mentioned above to specify output
    directory as part of the namelist input file.

  * The following files are retained from
    MEGAN_prep.tar.gz/prepmegan4wrfchem.tar.gz exactly as they were:

      area_mapper.dbg.f90  
      area_mapper.f90
      bio_types.f90
      constants_module.f90  
      misc_definitions_module.f90  

  * The following files are removed because they are not relevant
    here:

        megan_xform.f90
        surfdata_xform.f90

    If you ever need to use them, they can be found in the original
    preprocessor package for WRF-Chem (see prepmegan4wrfchem.tar.gz in
    this directory).

  * See prepmegan4cmaq.inp for sample namelist input file.

  * See run_prepmegan4cmaq.csh for example of how to run the preprocessor.
